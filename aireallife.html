                    AI use in GSK:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Target identification is one of the main way to start drug discovery. GSK uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning (ML) and genomics to identify drug discovery targets.</li>
                        <li>Targets of drug discovery are identified by AI, which analyses data and identify patterns or genetic targets for drug development.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Genetic targeting:<br>
                                AI could save a considerable amount of time, costs, and labour.</li>
                                <li>Biomarker data analysis:<br>
                                    By using AI/ML, complicated biomarker data can be analysed to find ways to strengthen clinical design, quicken the patient registration, and boost medication production.</li>

                    Iktos, founded in 2016, have the aim to innovate the drug discovery process to be more efficient.
                    They combine AI and robots to allow quicker and effective discovery of medical treatments.<br>
                    Their first successful collaborations of pharma was in 2018. Small molecules are the key to this rapid drug discovery,
                    since AI could identify the small molecules with the potential of being the effective drug.<br>
                    They have been collaborating with 50 academic and industrial companies, such as Jansenn, Ono, and Teijin.
