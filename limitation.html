                <p>
                    There are couple of big problems for AI to be included in drug discovery.<br>
                    To introduce AI into the medical field, the problems within it must be solved.<br>
                    - Technical Challenges<br>
                    - Ethical Challenges
                </p>
                <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
                <p>
                    AI in technical challenges.
                </p>
                <h2>Ethical Challenges</h2>
                <h3>Digital Gap</h3>
                <p>
                    Whether because of geography, gender, age, or lack of access to social networks, 
                    the digital divide could exacerbate the unequal access to health care.
                    This is significant between the developed countries and developing countries.<br>
                    Notable various problems that needs to be faced are ethical dilemmas, privacy security, consent, and medical advise.
                </p>
                <h3>Privacy security</h3>
                <p>
                    Authorised by Europian Union (EU), General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) amended the privacy legislation. 
                    Under these rules, in order to guarantee adequate protection of personal information, 
                    any personal data should be ensured to be handled by union-based data controllers.<br>
                    However, in the field of medical care, the legislations are not enough to ensure the privacy of the patient, as robots are often used to control the data:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Medical data of the patients could be hacked if robots gather.</li>
                        <li>Data of users could be collected in social networks without informed consent.</li>
                        <li>A few illegal or not examined bioinformatics companies gives data of the customers to the drug discovery companies.</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Social Gaps</h3>
                <p>
                    As AI develops, the social gaps associated with the digital gaps could become a greater issue.  
                    AI improves the science, technology, climate change and world events, however, worsens inequalities.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The gap between the developing and deveolped countries have increased by the progressive economies and automation.</li>
                        <li>Increase in unemployment and underemployment from the development of robots and AI, such as bookkeepers, surgeons, nurses.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>Medical advise and Emotions</h3>
                <p>
                    The reason introducing AI and robots into the health care field is almost impossible is because of the unique and delicate emotions and feelings of human.
                    Robots, which is a self-ruling system, cannot collaborate and discuss with the care takers, leading to human and robots not evolving together.
                    It is improbable for patients to welcome the machine to human relationships compared to human to human relationships.
                </p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Robots (not preferred) </th>
                        <th>Humans (preferred) </th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><img src="airobot.png" alt="aidoctor"></td>
                        <td><img src="doctor.png" alt="human"></td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <h3>Bias of AI</h3>
                <p>
                    The quality and the quantity of the data decides how well AI performs. 
                    Prejudices and inequities in health care could be increased by the limited data used in AI.<br>
                    The use of AI, for example in commercial prediction algorithms which are effective recognising health needs, could lead to notable racial bias. 
                    When health care costs are utilised to teach or train the system, black patients may be disadvantaged more than white patients.
                </p>
                <h3>Debiasing the AI:</h3>
                <p>
                    Ethical Application of AI could erase or reduce these risks:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Gathering applicable, high-quality data</li>
                        <li>Desigining AI and AI software properly</li>
                        <li>Establishing legislation and policies on the basis of widely accepted ethical principles</li>
                    </ul>
