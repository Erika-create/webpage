                    AI have a high possibility to be included in the medical care.
                    More lives could be saved if medicines and vaccines could be made more efficiently by the usage of AI.
                    However, the obstacles throughout makes the actual implementation in medical field of AI drugs long way.

                <h2>Current Problems</h2>
                <p>
                    Time and cost of drug discovery is extremely <span>inefficient</span>.
                    The current cost spent on medical care every year is 6-7% of global domestic product, which is US$8.5-9 trillion.
                    <table style="width:100%">
                        <tr>
                            <th>Cost</th>
                            <th>Time</th>
                            <th>Success Rate</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>$1 billion</td>
                            <td>14 years</td>
                            <td>10% (3% for cancer)</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>
                    <br>
                    As the success rate is extremely low, investing becomes risky,
                    resulting in the cost of accepted medications to <span>increase</span> to make up for the setbacks.
                </p>
                <h2>Benefits of AI in Drug Discovery</h2>
                <p>
                    Development of AI have contributed the notable growth of medical information recently.
                    Inclusion of AI could positively effect the drug discovery process:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Speeds up the drug discovery process by including AI for the medical data analysation</li>
                        <li>Failures could be prevented</li>
                        <li>Digitalisation of medical records could be benefitial in data-based methods</li>
                        <li>AI application in drug discovery includes:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>De novo molecular design and optimisation</li>
                            <li>Drug design based on the structure</li>
                            <li>Clinical trials</li>
                        </ul>
