                    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is included in many things, and recently, it has been started to be included in medical field.<br>
                    The main role of AI in medical care field is to analyse the human health data and medical machine images to enhance diagnoses and the result.<br>
                    It has been started to be included in drug discovery too, and it shows the potential to shorten the time of researching for a drug.
                    Drug discovery usually take up to 14 years, and in most of the case, fails to be included in the market.

                <p>
                    Toxicity must be tested in advance of utilised in human. 2 types of preclinical research are:
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>In vitro</span>: Tests conducted on samples such as blood or tissue which is taken out of the human body is In vitro diagnostics (IVD).</li>

                    </ul>
                    Typically, preclinical research is not conducted largely. Nevertheless, it has a crucial role in providing information about the dosing and toxicity, to determine if the drug should be attempted on humans.

                    Clinical research is a study or tests that is conducted on humans. 
                    For each of the Clinical Research Phases, scientists acknowledge the objective and start the Investigational New Drug Process (IND) while they arrange the clinical research.

                        For this, the team of FDA review would inspect the data of the medicine carefully if it should be allowed or not.

                            The file of drug application is called New Drug Application (NDA), which consists of all the data of the drug, such as:
                            <ul>

                            NDA would be determined if it is completed enough to be filed or not by FDA. 
                            When completed, NDA would be then examined by FDA, usually taking 6-10 months to be decided if it should be accpeted ot not.
                            The decision is made carefully through:
                            <ul>

                                <li>To the clinical trial sites, the FDA inspectors go for supervision. They check if there is any falsehood, manipulation, or deterring of data.</li>
                                <li>All of the reviewed data would be assembled into "action package" by the project manager. The senior team of FDA official makes a decision.</li>

                            Once FDA decides that the medicine is safe and useful, "labeling" is done, which is to clarify and improve the prescribing information.<br>
                            In most cases, FDA questions or requires another trials and studies to eliminate any problems.
